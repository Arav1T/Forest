# Forest
# time taken to create this project approx 6 hour
# three hooks are used that are usestate,useEffect,useContext, 
# for API fetching fect method is used 
# in navbar i have used fetch api because in assignment their is mention that "Add a button in the navbar saying 'Get users', which makes an API call to get the users data" 
# in user component i have use useEffect with fetch api method because if we will not use it then after reloading the page we will not get api data
